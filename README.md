###Details
Phaser's enables us to create visually appealing and easily organized JavaScript games.
While the game logic is entirely the same as a plain Javascript game (within the main.js), asset loading, variable assignment, and game state management are made easy.

This game effectively contains (in load order): boot.js, preload.js, gametitle.js, and main.js
