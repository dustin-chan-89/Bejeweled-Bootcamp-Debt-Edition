###Details
Phaser's framework enables us to create visually appealing and easily organized JavaScript games.

The game's logic is built entirely upon a JavaScript array. Phaser makes asset loading, variable assignment, and game state management clean and easy.

This game effectively contains (in load order): boot.js, preload.js, gametitle.js, and main.js
